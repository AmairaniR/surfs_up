# surfs_up
## Overview 
This analysis uses sqlite and sqlalchemy to retrieve the summary statistics for the temperatures for the months of June and December to determine whether opening up a surf shop is viable in Oahu year-round. 

## Results 
3 key differences in temperature statistics between [June](https://github.com/AmairaniR/surfs_up/blob/main/resources/June_Temps.png) and [December](https://github.com/AmairaniR/surfs_up/blob/main/resources/Dec_Temps.png)

-The temperatures for June are slightly higher than for December, this is demonstrated by the mean which for June is 74.94 and for December is 71.04. 

-It gets much colder in December than it does in June. The minimum temperature for Decmeber is 56, while the min temperature for June is 64. 

-The maximum temperature for June is also higher than it is for December. In June it is 85, in December it is 83. 

## Summary
Based on the temperature, there is not a significant difference between the temperatures in June and in December. I also performed additional queries to determine the average [rainfall in June](https://github.com/AmairaniR/surfs_up/blob/main/resources/June_Rain.png) and in [December](https://github.com/AmairaniR/surfs_up/blob/main/resources/Dec_Rain.png). Both receive very little rain with averages of 0.13 and 0.22 respectively. However, the month of December gets slightly more rain and has a higher maximum precipitation of 6.42 whereas the maximum precipitation for June is 4.43.
